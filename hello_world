//Making my first program on C++ ever

/*the #include means that you gonna load something i guess
Meanwhile iostreams means input,output, stream.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
//that over this is just for saying that that whill be present every time we use something from the module.

//This is just a function
//cout means C out, so, your printing some shit on the console.
//endl is endline is for making a space between code lines in the console.

int main() {
	cout <<"Hello world!"<<endl;
	return 0;
}

//you return to 0 because somebody says it have to.
